    a title (e.g. "Pomodoro Timer First Brainstorm")
    subtitle for the meeting section/the topic of the meeting (e.g. "brainstorming", "check-ins", "documentation")
    subtitle for the date
    attendance list
    agenda of what the meeting will cover
    things that were unfinished business from last meeting
    things that are new business that need to be talked about
    any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
    pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
        SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
    For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.

Document metadata

Metadata elements are not rendered to your webpage, rather they are used by the browser to provide extra information to your webpage like a title and icon in the browser tab bar or a description of your website

    -title
    -meta
    -link (usually <link> is used to link a stylesheet, but since we're not using CSS, you can use it to link a favicon instead)

 

Content sectioning

Sectioning tags are necessary for your browser to correctly understand the structure of your webpage. Correct webpage sectioning helps in areas like Search Engine Optimization. Note that the way that you section your webpage does NOT have to be exactly how the webpage is structured visually, rather think of your section elements as a guide to your web browser on how your page should be interpreted.

    -main
    -header, footer
    -nav
    -h1, h2, h3
    -section

 

Text content

Text elements help you format your text content allowing you to add styles and structure to how your text is rendered to the screen. A lot of these elements will produce the same effect visually, however remember that we are writing our HTML for the web browser so make sure to check out the Mozilla documentation to understand when to use each element. Your visual aesthetic can be developed using CSS - but we won't be using CSS for this lab :)

    div, span (these elements may not be too useful without CSS / JavaScript, but are too important to leave out, so just include them somewhere in your document. It’s okay if they aren’t useful)
    -hr
    -p
    -ul
    -ol
    -li

 

Inline text semantics

Inline text elements are used inline with your text to provide meaning to specific parts of a text section.

    -b
    -strong (know the differences between b and strong)
    -i
    -em (know the differences between i and em)
    -a
    -br

 

Images and multimedia

    -img
    audio
    video

 

Interactive Elements

Interactive elements provides your webpage with some basic interactive functionality without the use of Javascript. 

    -details
    -summary

 

Forms

This isn't really related to the concept of meeting minutes, but we want you to include it anyways as forms are a crucial aspect of HTML. The form itself doesn't have to be related to your meeting minutes at all and can be about whatever you like. Create a simple (non-functional since we're not using JavaScript) form at the bottom of your page. Use the following elements:

    -form
    -fieldset
    -input (of types checkbox, radio, text, and date)*
    -textarea
    -datalist
    -select
    -option
    -button

*You need to have at least one input of each type specified.
